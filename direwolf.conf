#	soam.aprs2.net		- for South America
#	euro.aprs2.net		- for Europe and Africa
#	asia.aprs2.net 		- for Asia
#	aunz.aprs2.net		- for Oceania 

# Round-Robin Servers in Japan
#   japan.aprs2.net     - Round Robin Connect, Tier 2 Server in Japan

IGSERVER japan.aprs2.net

# You also need to specify your login name and passcode. 
# Contact the author if you can't figure out how to generate the passcode.
